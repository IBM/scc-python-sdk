    Get the request headers to be sent in requests by the SDK.
    
    If you plan to gather metrics for your SDK, the User-Agent header value must
    be a string similar to the following:
    my-python-sdk/0.0.1 (lang=python; arch=x86_64; os=Linux; python.version=3.7.4)
    In the example above, the analytics tool will parse the user-agent header and
    use the following properties:
    "my-python-sdk" - the name of your sdk
    "0.0.1"- the version of your sdk
    "lang=python" - the language of the current sdk
    "arch=x86_64; os=Linux; python.version=3.7.4" - system information
    Note: It is very important that the sdk name ends with the string `-sdk`,
    as the analytics data collector uses this to gather usage data.
